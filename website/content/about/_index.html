We are a CNCF Special Interest Group responsible for advising the Technical
Oversight Committee and CNCF projects on strategies related to building,
scaling, and retaining contributor communities, including governance,
communications, operations, and tools. We want to help grow flourishing,
sustainable communities with smooth journeys throughout their CNCF project
lifecycle.
